## My process

# What-I-Learned

This project was a great exercise in layout and styling. I learned some key CSS concepts that are crucial for building modern web components.

One of the main takeaways was understanding how to properly center an element both vertically and horizontally. I learned that for align-items: center to work, the parent container (body in this case) must have a defined height. Using min-height: 100vh was the solution.

I also learned how to create a solid, offset box-shadow to give the card a 3D effect, which was different from the typical soft, blurry shadow. Setting the blur radius to 0 was the key.

Finally, I solidified my understanding of responsive design by using max-width instead of a fixed width on the main card. This allows the component to shrink gracefully on smaller screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

Advanced CSS: I plan to dive deeper into concepts like CSS custom properties (variables) to make my stylesheets more maintainable and easier to theme.

Accessibility: I want to ensure my projects are usable by everyone by focusing more on semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

JavaScript: My next goal is to start incorporating JavaScript to add more complex interactivity to my projects.
